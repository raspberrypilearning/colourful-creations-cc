## Using hex colour codes



Python turtle has predefined colours such as 'red' and 'white' but you can also use hex colour codes (you may have seen these in the HTML & CSS course.) 

+ Open the blank Python template Trinket: <a href="http://jumpto.cc/python-new" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/python-new</a>. 

+ Add the following set up code for using the turtle:

    Notice that you used a named colour: 'white'.
    
+ Turtle has a list of colour names that you can use, but sometimes you want to choose your own colours. Turtle also allows you to use hex colour codes. 

  Open <a href="http://jumpto.cc/colour-picker" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/colour-picker</a> and choose colour you like. Find it's hex code beginning with a '#', such as '#A7E30E'. 
  
+ Copy the hex code, including the hash, by highlighting it and then right-clicking and choosing Copy, or using Ctrl-C. 
  
+ Now change the line of code that sets the screen colour to use your colour. For example:

   You can use right-click and Paste or Ctrl-V to paste your hex code into trinket. 
  
+ Choose another hex colour code and use it to create coloured text:

   You don't have to use the 'Arial' font, you could try 'Verdana', 'Times' or 'Courier'.
   
   '40' is the font size, you can try changing that too.  
   
+ Try different colours until you get two that you really like that look good together.
