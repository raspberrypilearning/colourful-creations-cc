## A Colour Dictionary


 
Using hex colour codes is really flexible but they are hard to remember. 

As you probably already know, a dictionary allows you to look up a word, and see itâ€™s meaning. In Python, a dictionary is even more flexible that that - it allows you to look up a value for any 'key' in the dictionary.

Let's create a dictionary to map from human-friendly colour names (keys) to computer-friendly hex codes (values).

+ A dictionary is contained in curly brackets. 

  Create an empty dictionary called `colours`:

+ Choose cool names for your colours and edit the `colours = ` line to add entries to the dictionary for them. 

  Here's an example colour dictionary:

   A colon `:` separates the key (colour name) from the value (hex code.) You need a comma `,` between each key:value pair in the dictionary. 

+ Now you don't need to remember the hex codes, you can just look them up in the dictionary. 

  Adapt the following code to use your colour names:

  The key goes inside square brackets '[]' after the name of the dictionary. 
  
+ Now you can update your code to look up colours in the dictionary:

+ Test your code to make sure your text still displays correctly.
